 * twinpeak_geff.c - Plugin for CLASS to implement a time-varying Newton's constant G_eff(a)

 * The amplitude of each peak is set by parameters A1 and A2, and locations by ln(a1) = z1, ln(a2) = z2.
 * (Here z1, z2 correspond to entries in Symbols_and_Abbr.md for twin-peak positions.)

/*
 * Integration with CLASS:
 * To use this plugin, incorporate G_eff_over_GN(a) into CLASS where gravitational constant appears.
 * For example, in CLASS's background.c, multiply relevant density terms by G_eff_over_GN(a).
 * Ensure to recompile CLASS after adding this module.
